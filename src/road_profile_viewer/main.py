Road Profile Viewer - Interactive 2D Visualization
===================================================
This module contains the entire application in a single file (intentionally monolithic
for educational purposes). It creates an interactive Dash application that visualizes:
- A road profile represented by a clothoid-like curve
- A camera mounted at position (0, 1.5)
- A ray from the camera that can be rotated by the user
- The intersection point between the ray and the road profile
- Distance information on hover
